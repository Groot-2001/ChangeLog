<h3>Changelog App Backend (Nodejs,Typescript,Express,prisma,postgresSQL)</h3>
<p>A changelog is a log or record of all notable changes made to a project.
The project is often a website or software project, and the changelog usually includes records of changes such as bug fixes, new features, etc.
A changelog has historically included all changes made to a project. The "Keep a Changelog" site instead advocates that a changelog not include all changes, 
  but that it should instead contain "a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project" 
  and should not be a "dump" of a git log "because this helps nobody"
